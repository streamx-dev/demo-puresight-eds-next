## Publication to StreamX

StreamX currently supports two types of content sources, each with its own set of GitHub workflows.
Depending on the content source and the action performed, the appropriate workflow is triggered
automatically to publish or unpublish content.

### 1. EDS Workflows

These workflows handle publishing and unpublishing pages via Edge Delivery Services (EDS):

- [publish-to-streamx.yaml](.github/workflows/publish-to-streamx.yaml)
- [unpublish-from-streamx.yaml](.github/workflows/unpublish-from-streamx.yaml)

When a page is published or unpublished, the corresponding workflow is triggered automatically
and sends a request to the StreamX instance.

### 2. Helix Workflows

This workflow handles publishing of web resources via Helix:

- [webresource-publish-to-streamx.yaml](.github/workflows/webresource-publish-to-streamx.yaml)

When a pull request is merged into the `main` branch, the web resource synchronization workflow is triggered.

### Configuration Requirements
The workflows require several configuration options, defined as variables and secrets:

- Variable `EDS_DOMAIN_URL`: a URL to Edge Delivery Services domain,
  e.g.: `https://main--demo-puresight-eds-next--streamx-dev.hlx.live`.
- Variable `STREAMX_PUBLICACTION_BASE_URL`: a base URL to StreamX publication API,
  e.g.: `https://ingestion.streamx.tech`.
- Variable `STREAMX_PAGE_PUBLICATION_API`: a URL to StreamX publication API,
  e.g.: `https://ingestion.streamx.tech/publications/v1/channels/pages/messages`.
- Variable `STREAMX_INGESTION_WEBRESOURCE_INCLUDES`: a path patterns list of accepted webresources,
  e.g.: `["scripts/*.js", "styles/*.css"]`.
- Secret `STREAMX_TOKEN`: JWT value required by StreamX publication API.

Workflows can be
[enabled and disabled manually in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow).
